    " # Time and Space Complexity\n",
    " \n",
    "Let's analyze the time and space complexity of the operations:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Append (`text_editor.append`)**:\n",
    "    - **Time Complexity**: The operation `self.string += item` has a time complexity of O(k), where k is the length of the item being appended. Appending an item to a list (`self.stack.append(self.string)`) is O(1) in average time complexity. However, when considering the string creation and appending, the overall time complexity is dominated by the length of the `item` string.\n",
    "    - **Space Complexity**: Each time you append, you're storing the current string in the stack. So, for the stack, it's O(n) for each append, where n is the length of the string at that point.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Delete (`text_editor.delete`)**:\n",
    "    - **Time Complexity**: Slicing a string (`self.string[:-index]`) is O(n), where n is the length of the string. Appending to the stack is O(1) in average time complexity, but with the string involved, it's O(n).\n",
    "    - **Space Complexity**: Similar to append, you're storing the current string in the stack. So, O(n) for each delete operation.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Print (`text_editor.print_string`)**:\n",
    "    - **Time Complexity**: Accessing an element by index in a string is O(1).\n",
    "    - **Space Complexity**: This operation doesn't use any extra space other than the input, so it's O(1).\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Undo (`text_editor.undo`)**:\n",
    "    - **Time Complexity**: Popping from a stack (`self.stack.pop()`) is O(1).\n",
    "    - **Space Complexity**: While the undo operation itself doesn't consume more space, it's worth noting that when an undo operation is executed, it reduces the space used by the stack by freeing up the top string. However, the space complexity for the operation itself is O(1).\n",
    "\n",
    "For the entire program:\n",
    "The overall time complexity for your program will be determined by the most time-consuming operation you have, given the constraints of your input.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here's a breakdown:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. The main loop, which processes commands, runs for `user_input` times, which can be denoted as \\( m \\). Inside this loop, you handle one of the four commands each time.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. The **Append** operation has a time complexity of \\( O(k) \\), where \\( k \\) is the length of the string being appended.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. The **Delete** operation has a time complexity of \\( O(n) \\), where \\( n \\) is the length of the string from which characters are being deleted.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Print** and **Undo** operations have constant time complexity \\( O(1) \\).\n",
    "\n",
    "Considering the above, in the worst-case scenario:\n",
    "\n",
    "- If you're mostly appending long strings, the dominant time complexity would be \\( O(m \\times k) \\).\n",
    "\n",
    "- If you're mostly deleting from long strings, the dominant time complexity would be \\( O(m \\times n) \\).\n",
    "\n",
    "Since in each iteration you're performing one operation (either append or delete or print or undo), the overall time complexity, in the worst case, is:\n",
    "\\[ O(m \\times \\max(k, n)) \\]\n",
    "\n",
    "Where:\n",
    "- \\( m \\) is the number of operations.\n",
    "- \\( k \\) is the average length of strings being appended.\n",
    "- \\( n \\) is the average length of the string from which characters are being deleted.\n",
    "\n",
    "Given that both \\( k \\) and \\( n \\) represent string lengths in different scenarios, you can also represent the complexity as $( O(m \\times s) )$ where \\( s \\) is the average size of the string being manipulated (either through append or delete) in each operation."
