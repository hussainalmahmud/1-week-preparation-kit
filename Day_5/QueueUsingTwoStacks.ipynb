This might seem O(n) for a single `dequeue` operation in the worst case, but note that each item is moved from `stack1` to `stack2` only once and then it's popped from `stack2` in O(1). Thus, when amortized over multiple operations, this becomes an average of O(1) for each `dequeue` operation. This is an example of **amortized O(1)** complexity.\n",
